Firstly I would like to thank my thesis guide Zahra Boroujeni for her advice and help in various phases during my candidature. I am indebted to the Dahlem Center for Machine Learning and Robotics where I have met many fellow students who walked along and helped me understand various concepts of autonomous vehicles and provided valuable feedback during the discussions. I am thankful to Prof. Dr. Raúl Rojas and Prof. Dr. Daniel Göhring who have hosted me in their lab and supported me with the required resources during my thesis. 

I am thankful to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Reinhard Karnapke, Prof. Dr. Habil. Odej Kao, Dr.-Ing. Daniel Graff for supervising my thesis at TU-Berlin and providing valuable advice on refining the thesis scope and help in streamlining my work.
