\chapter{Implementation}
\label{implementation}
Check if this chapter is needed, 

Here I can write mostly about how the state machine is implemented to choose profiles

How the collision check is implemented

Further details on how these trajectories are converted to x,y coordinates used by the trajectory follower and the constraints in implementation for model car will be discussed in

How costs are added


How the messages flow, 


Which messages are received, which messages to be 

I would prefer to finish this in Planning Chapter 

speak about splines, how the state machine works, write a flowchart etc

how the conversion happens and where it happens etc etc
