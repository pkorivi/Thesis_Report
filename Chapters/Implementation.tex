\chapter{Implementation}
\label{implementation}
Check if this chapter is needed, 

Write a flow chart describing various functions implemented 

How the collision check is implemented

Further details on how these trajectories are converted to x,y coordinates used by the trajectory follower and the constraints in implementation for model car will be discussed in

How costs are added

Which messages are used for what, who sends what and who receives what - flow diagrams

speak about splines, how the state machine works, write a flowchart etc

Inform when which order splines are good to implemented

need for adding extra costs if this has to be ported for full scale cars

Issues -
