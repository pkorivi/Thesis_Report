\section{Future Work}
Replace by smoother polynomials over splines, especially in curves and when not following centre lane, they tend to be very bad. 

// Diss shui thesis - read though page 80 and understand further on benefits and demerits of polynomials vs splines. Add some in evaluation and some in future work


Prediction of state from where the planner should start planning instead of current position. 
Due to inaccuracies in current planners measurement of speed and acceleration it is tough to estimate where the vehicle will be when the planner is under execution. Currently based on assumption that the vehicle will follow the current path for next few ms, it is made offset in control node. This can be improved to have better synchronizaton between planner and controller. 


Create two functions to map lateral shift as a function of time and distance based on speed over current function only mapping based on distance.  

Use quintic polynomials at high speeds and cubic at low speeds.
