\chapter*{Abstract}
The goal of any motion planner is to achieve a driving trajectory that is collision free, smooth and responsive (reactive), at the same time being far-sighted to maintain consistency, deliberative and allow smooth transitions. This thesis proposes a hierarchical sampling based algorithm designed especially for small robotic vehicles operating in structured dynamic urban environments. The first layer in motion planner creates a reference path from an obstacle-free road network definition file. The next motion planning layer creates multiple forward projecting samples (acceleration and lateral motion), and a pre-cost is assigned to them based on their closeness to expected behaviour. Trajectories are generated and evaluated in the lowest first order of the samples till the top of the stack has the lowest cost evaluated trajectory. This reduces the need to evaluate hundreds of trajectories when the trajectory with expected behaviour is found. 

The next step in motion planning is to evaluate that the created trajectories are collision-free with respect to static and dynamic obstacles in the scene. This thesis employs a two-step collision detection for static obstacles by checking maximum of four points on the trajectory to decide whether trajectory is collision free. For collision testing with dynamic obstacles, the approach to test for static obstacles is extended to check for collision in time when there is a collision in space. 

With all the proposed techniques the planner is able to generate feasible trajectories that are collision free and able to run on low computational platforms such as modelcar.
