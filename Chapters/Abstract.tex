\chapter*{Abstract}
The goal of any motion planner is to achieve a driving trajectory that is collision free, smooth and responsive (reactive), at the same time being far-sighted to maintain consistency, deliberative and allow smooth transitions. Prior approaches solved this problem through different methods having various complexity levels. This thesis proposes an on road motion planner with combination of path-velocity combination along with a low computational overhead collision avoidance system. The reactive nature tunability of the proposed thesis is suitable for urban driving scenarios.
